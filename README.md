# Industry-Core-Infrastructure
# A British company has been growing its business since its infancy stage. Their sales have been good as they deal with office infrastructure. However, the VP of Sales is not very happy with the refunds that the company has been providing to its customers. The VP wanted a decision-driven method rather than a traditional approach to deriving a strategy. 
# Objective: As  a  first  step  the  VP  planned  to  evaluate  all  the  BI  tools  available  in  the market. Tableau was selected as it met his requirements. Using Tableau, he wanted his team members to give him the forecast of Sales for the next year and the probability of  refunds  category-wise  for  a  year.  This  will  help  him  plan  his  next  steps  to  avoid  the refunds. He wanted a dashboard that would contain the following:•A list of orders returned by customers from the Top 10 Countries (in terms of refund)•Top 10 Countries mapped on the World Map that had most of the refunds•Predict the refund for the next 1-year category-wise
